This app allows you to create and save photo albums associated with locations around the world.

The first view displays a map with all of your saved pins and using a tap and hold gesture will allow you to drop a new pin.

Selecting a pin takes you to the photo album view where a set of 21 photos associated with the selected location will be displayed. Photos can be deleted and a new set of photos can be fetched.
